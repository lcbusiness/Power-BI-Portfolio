# Power Query Fix Examples 

These are on the job emails sent to assist the other admin with Power BI

# Email sent Debugging Errors to my Major:

In the reports I have fixed the errors for the Z reports and the data now loads on my end.

In Power Query aka Transform Data:

There appear to be errors in the S8 report, the error occurs in columns OBLIG and COMMIT, means that some rows are trying to Divide by 0.

Clicking on the column with the ID’s such as W…Z09… we must remove blanks by going to Remove Rows on the home ribbon and then removing the blanks.

Then do the same to the Conditional Column (custom column). Then Refresh.

# Refresh error corrected due to MS Teams storage location of sources data fix:

S1 Manning Doc Load Issue corrected by Saving As and removing encryption, new manning Doc can be dragged and dropped in Teams Power BI without error. Stress testing now to resolve issues if she removes rows, should be easy because new columns are not added.
